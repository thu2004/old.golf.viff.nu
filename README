== About Refinery

Refinery is a simple, easy to use, well presented content manager for small businesses.

Refinery was born out of Resolve Digital (http://resolvedigital.co.nz). 
After building 40 real client sites, we began making our own content manager which would suit the small businesses we worked with. We learnt all the common requests and included them and nothing more.

rake db:schema:load
rake db:seed

== Starting up your site
ruby script/server

Now in your browser go to http://localhost:3000 and your site should be running.

You will be prompted to setup your first user.

== Environment required

Refinery runs using a number of gems which (as of Refinery version 0.9.5) are outlined below:

- "rake", :version => ">= 0.8.3"
- "friendly_id", :version => ">= 2.2.2"
- "mislav-will_paginate", :version => ">= 2.3.11"
- "rails", :version => ">= 2.3.4"
- "rubyist-aasm", :version => ">= 2.1.3"

== Updates to core files

If you are running Refinery as a gem, updates are simple to incorporate into your project.
Simply run the command 'refinery-update-core /path/to/project' and the up-to-date core files will be copied from the latest gem into your project's directory. 
Note: the directory that you specify here must be the Rails root for the project.

If you are running using a git clone, you can update by running these commands:

git remote add refinerycms git://github.com/resolve/refinerycms.git
git pull refinerycms master

This will pull in all of the updated files in the project and may result in some merge conflicts which you will need to resolve.
