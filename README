== About Refinery

Refinery is a simple, easy to use, well presented content manager for small businesses.

Refinery was born out of Resolve Digital (resolvedigital.co.nz). After building 40 real client
sites, we began making our own content manager which would suit the small businesses we
worked with. We learnt all the common requests and included them and nothing more.
