== Generating Thumbnails

Refinery lets you generate a range of thumbnails when an image is uploaded so you can output this on a page in an appropriate size.

To specify the sizes of your thumbnails edit the "Image Thumbnails" setting.

This setting is stored as a serialize hash and is directly passed to attachment_fu

Here's what the default looks like

  --- 
  :grid: c135x135
  :lightbox: 500x500>
  :dialog_thumb: c106x106
  :medium: 225x255
  :preview: c96x96
  :thumb: 50x50
  :side_body: 300x500

Refinery requires some of these so you won't want to delete any, but add new ones to meet your design needs. Each thumbnail is not just a size guide but a RMagick geometry string that allows you to define min and max size too.

Refinery also extends the geometry string support to allow cropping. Here's some examples

  :grid: c135x135
  
This will crop (that's what the "c" stands for) the image down to 135x135 exactly without stretching the image.

Note: you will have to restart your web server after changing this setting for the changes to take effect.
