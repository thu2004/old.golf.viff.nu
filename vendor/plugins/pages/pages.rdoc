= Pages

== About

One core part of is Pages. Plugins such as news and inquiries hook to pages. The menu is rendered based off the structure of your pages.

Pages have one key thing about them that is unique - page parts.

== Page Parts

=== What are they

Think of a page part is a single piece of content on your page. At www.resolvedigital.co.nz we often simply use +body+ and +side_body+. One is for the main content and one is for the content which goes on a side bit of the page to display other information.

=== Default Page Parts

You can change what the default page parts are called or add more by editing the "Default Page Parts" setting. This is a serialize array of names. The default looks like this

  --- 
  - body
  - side_body
  
Add more to this setting if you want more default page parts.

=== Adding Page Parts for Specify Pages

You can add extra page parts to your pages by setting the "New Page Parts" to true and editing the page you want to add a part to and clicked the little "+" icon.

Note in the user-facing front end we call them "content sections" not "page parts".

== Page Options

=== Draft/Published

You can have draft and published pages. This is controlled by checking and unchecking the "Save as Draft" field on the page form, when editing the page.

=== Custom Title

There are three options for how the page title will be rendered on the front end.

* None - will just default to the page title
* Text - allows you to have a different name for the page in the backend to the front end (sometimes good for SEO)
* Image - If you're designer is using a custom non-standard web font, this is ideal. Bang the image of your title right in there (we don't recommend this though!)

=== Show in menu

You can hide a page from the navigation if you like by unchecking "show in menu"

=== Custom URL

This allows you to make your page not link to a normal page but make it show something else. This could be a donation link to a completely different site for example. Or as Refinery uses it, you might want to link to another plugin.

The "contact us" page for example has a Custom URL of "/inquiries/new" because we want it to load the inquiries form from the inquiries plugin instead.

=== WYMEditor (the WYSIWYG visual editor)

Refinery is backed by http://www.wymeditor.org/

It's a standards compliant editor that we've trimmed to only have what we feel is absolutely necessary. When you're editing the content is a page part you're using WYMEditor.

You can also switch to "source" view and edit XHTML manually.

=== Custom selectable styles in WYMEditor

Some sites require a little more than just your standard bold and heading controls. This is where the "css" style drop down comes in hand.

It allows your customers to select a style you define.

* MORE INFO NEEDED

=== Dialogs that show from WYMEditor

== Page Link dialog

The link dialog lets you link in several different ways

* To an internal page
* To an external page
* To an email address
* To a resource you've uploaded in the Resources tab.

== Insert Image dialog

Simply lets you select from an existing image found in the Images tab or upload a new one right within the dialog.

== Refinery Default Pages

Some pages you have to keep in order for Refinery to fully function.

* Page not found - the default 404 page, it's hidden from the navigation,
* Down for maintenance - renders when you're site is being updated.
